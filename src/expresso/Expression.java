    /**
     * Parse an expression.
     * @param input expression to parse
     * @return expression AST for the input that is mathematically equivalent to the desired Expression,
     *         whose toString() method returns a String that includes all numbers,
     *         letters, and operations of the input, appearing  in the same order.
     *         Parentheses in the output are distributed as follows:
     *         1) If the input is a single variable name or number, no parentheses are shown (i.e. 5 -> 5, (mf) -> mf)
     *         2) Else each number and variable in the expression is encapsulated in its own set of 
     *            parentheses. Then, for all the sets of grouped operations implied by the parentheses in the 
     *            input, parentheses are distributed around the two Monomials involved in that operation.
     *            Operations in Innermost levels are considered first.
     *            For operations that are in the same nested level, parentheses are distributed around pairs of numbers
     *            or letters being multiplied first, from left to right, then parentheses group sums from right to left
     *            up until the left-most plus sign in that level if the level of the sum takes the least precedence.
     *            If the right variable or number in an operation-paired set is already doubly encapsulated in parentheses
     *            as a result of putting parentheses around all numbers and variables (which occurs when parentheses
     *            are in the input), no further parentheses are distributed for the operation involved.
     *            
     *            Examples: The input x * y + x * y + x * y + x has multiple variables, so the output 
     *                      would so far have: (x) * (y) + (x) * (y) + (x) * (y) + (x)
     *                      After grouping multiplied terms left to right: ((x) * (y)) + ((x) * (y)) + ((x) * (y)) + (x)
     *                      Then sums from right to left: ((x) * (y)) + (((x) * (y)) + (((x) * (y)) + (x)))
     *                      And this is what would be printed.
     *                      
     *                      The input x + ((x * y) + x) + x * y * (x + y) would be transformed as follows:
     *                      After encapsulating all variables: (x) + (((x) * (y)) + (x)) + (x) * (y) * ((x) + (y))
     *                      Then the innermost operations are considered first. In this case, it would be the first occurrence of
     *                      ((x) * (y)). Because the y is already covered with two parentheses as a result of the input parentheses,
     *                      no additional parentheses are placed. Next, the addition operation immediately following is the first occurrence
     *                      of an operation on its level, and no multiplication operations are on its level, so parentheses would be distributed
     *                      around the numbers and variables that it operates on, but because the x to the right of the addition is covered with
     *                      2 parentheses, none are added. By similar reasoning, no parentheses are added for the other addition on its level
     *                      (the rightmost addition). After looking at the multiplication in the lower level, we get:
     *                      (x) + (((x) * (y)) + (x)) + ((x) * (y)) * ((x) + (y)) followed by (x) + (((x) * (y)) + (x)) + (((x) * (y)) * ((x) + (y))).
     *                      Next, since the sum in the same level with the multiplications is not on the most primitive level, we consider it, even
     *                      though it is the left-most sum on its level. Thus, we get (x) + ((((x) * (y)) + (x)) + (((x) * (y)) * ((x) + (y))))
     *                      The final sum operation is then ignored, and the output reveals the expression above.
     *            
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if the expression is invalid
     *         Invalid inputs are defined as having at least one of the following characteristics:
     *           1) Unbalanced parentheses
     *           2) Letters and numbers that appear immediately after one another with no separation
     *              by operations (x9u, 3.00f2, 5 y, 3x, etc.)
     *           3) Numbers with more than one decimal, letters that are in the immediate vicinity of a
     *              decimal (i.e. would appear right next to one if spaces are removed), or variable names
     *              or numbers that include spaces or parentheses
     *           4) Invalid operations (-, /, ^, or any character that is not a letter, number, decimal,
     *              +, *, space, or parenthesis.)
     *           5) One or more operative symbols that do not have a left and right subexpression
     *              to perform their respective operations on such that both subexpressions would be
     *              valid stand-alone inputs (t + (), a + , etc.) In this case, valid subexpressions
     *              do not include empty Strings even though an empty input is a valid
     *              query (ending the program), so inputs like "6 +" are also considered invalid.
